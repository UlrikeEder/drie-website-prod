                            <p>Owning and maintaining a data center has resource and security requirements that are becoming increasingly complex to meet. Time to carefully evaluate options for moving infrastructure and platforms however is scarce, leading to delays and lost progress on improving IT efficiency. Adopting drie will allow you to benefit from large resource pools in distributed data center environments that are run for you, leaving that operational overhead to us. Integrated AWS security best practices to make sure that your data, at all times, is safe.
